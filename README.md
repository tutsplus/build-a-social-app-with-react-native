# [Build a Social App With React Native][published url]
## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]


React Native, created by Facebook, lets you write native mobile apps in modern JavaScript that will be transformed into native views specific to your supported platforms. This avoids some of the drawbacks of a web-based mobile applications, which often have poor performance and lack features that users expect from native apps. However, almost everything that can be done in a native app, is possible in JavaScript with React Native. This makes React Native a great way to get into mobile app development without learning a new programming language or switching to a heavy IDE. 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Markus Mühlberger will show you how to create a social application in React Native. You will learn how to build an app easily with a Firebase backend. You'll also learn some more advanced topics like sophisticated view routing, camera and photo library access, as well as how to use the device's address book.
